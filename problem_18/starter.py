CodingQuest Problem 18: Inventory check

Your input data is in input.txt.
The data has been loaded into a list called `data` for you.
Each item in the list is one line from the file, as a string.

Each line has three parts separated by spaces:
  - A unique item ID
  - A quantity (number)
  - A category name

Write your solution below the comment line.
